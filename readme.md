## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paraglondhe098/2D_Avatar_Generation.git
   cd 2D_Avatar_Generation
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running the Streamlit app command.
2. Use the sidebar sliders to adjust the attributes for image generation:
   - Example attributes include **Eye Angle**, **Chin Length**, **Hair Color**, and more.
3. Generated images will be displayed in a grid layout.
4. Adjust sliders to modify attributes and generate new images.
